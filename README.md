## Description
### General
_If you are interested in secure online experience you should have strong and different passwords for each service you use._
**Password Manager** is an application which can help you to generate and store strong passwords from different services.
To access your passwords you only need *Master Password*.
Password Manager only saves hash of usernames and passwords, so anyone who will get DB will not be able to get real creds without *Master Password*
### Realisation
This project based on *Telegram Messanger* which allows programmers to develop their own bots.
CLI version of most Password Managers limits users to use it on PC. 
At this point Telegram Bot can be used on **mobile phones, PCs and browsers** with access to the Internet.
### Telegram Bot
Using this telebot you can easily add, edit, delete any profiles (*profile - username and hash for particular service*).
`Telebot is individual password manager. It means that in most cases you are the only user of the bot.`
